# Change Log

All notable changes to the "virtual-space" extension will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

- Initial release

## 0.0.2

- Renamed the extension to avoid confusion
  - Visual Studio 2019 already has a concept of [Virtual Space](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-manage-editor-modes?view=vs-2019) that appear to be completely different from what this extension provides. ([#1](https://github.com/VolcanicBytes/VirtualWorkspace/issues/1))
